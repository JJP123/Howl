Howl
====

An open-source, free, ageless, authless social network where anyone of any age, ethnicity, and race can get on.

Languages
---------

Howl uses these web development languages:

jQuery
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

If you don't know these languages, you probably won't want to work on this. ;)

Methods
-------

At the Home page, there are just a couple of fields. After you type and click "Submit", the JS gathers the values and puts
it out on the page with the jQuery $(element).prepend() method.



I'm looking forward to working on this together!
